//Level - 2 Problem 1: Bank Withdrawal System with Custom Exception
//Scenario:
//A bank wants to implement a withdrawal system that throws a custom exception when a customer attempts to withdraw more money than available in their account.
//Requirements:
//1.Create a class BankAccount with a private field balance.
//2.	Create a method Withdraw(double amount).
//3.	Create a custom exception class InsufficientBalanceException.
//4.Throw the custom exception if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance.
//5.	Handle the exception in the main program using try-catch.
//6.Ensure proper cleanup using a finally block.
//Technical Constraints:
//•	Use custom exception classes by inheriting from Exception.
//•	Implement error propagation by throwing exceptions from methods.
//•	Handle exceptions in the calling method.
//Expectations:
//•	Demonstrate creation and usage of custom exceptions.
//•	Implement proper exception handling in calling code.
//•	Display user-friendly error messages.
//Learning Outcome:
//•	Learn how to create custom exceptions.
//•	Understand throw and error propagation.
//•	Apply structured exception handling in real - world scenarios.
//Sample Input:
//Balance = 3000
// Withdraw = 5000
//Sample Output:
//Error: Withdrawal amount exceeds available balance
